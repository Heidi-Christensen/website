<p>I am a Senior Lecturer in <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs">Computer Science</a> and a member
of the <a href="http://catch.org.uk/">Centre for Assistive Technology and Connected
Healthcare (CATCH)</a> at the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk">University of
Sheffield</a>. I am also part of the <a href="http://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/">Speech and Hearing Research Group
(SPandH)</a> and a member of the <a href="https://mhs.group.shef.ac.uk/">Sheffield Medical Humanities
(MHS)</a>. I am a theme lead for the newly announced UKRI <a href="https://slt-cdt.ac.uk/">Centre for
Doctoral Training in speech and language technologies and their applications</a>.</p>

<p>I am the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/about/equality-diversity-inclusion">Faculty Director for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion</a>.

<p>I am interested in the application of audio and speech technology to
the healthcare domain. My interests include:</p>

<ul>
<li>human-computer interfaces such as conversational interfaces to domestic robots, dialogue systems and automatic speech recognition of disordered speech,</li>
<li>communication technologies that can help people communicate with other people,</li>
<li>computer-aided audio, speech and language analysis, e.g. classifying dementia or detecting abnormal pronunciation patters, and
speech and language generating technologies such as speech synthesis
with a personalised voice.</li>
</ul>
