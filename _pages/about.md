<p>I am a Senior Lecturer in <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs">Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk">University of Sheffield</a> and a member
of the <a href="http://catch.org.uk/">Centre for Assistive Technology and Connected

Sheffield</a>. I am part of the <a href="http://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/">Speech and Hearing Research Group
(SPandH)</a> and a theme lead for the UKRI <a href="https://slt-cdt.ac.uk/">Centre for
Doctoral Training in speech and language technologies and their applications</a>.</p>

<p>I have a long-standing interest in improving equality and diversity and I am the current <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/about/equality-diversity-inclusion">Faculty Director for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion</a>.

<p>My research interests are in the application of audio and speech technology to
the healthcare domain and include two main areas</p>

<ul>

<li>the detection and tracking of verbal and non-verbal traits in speech and language</li>
</ul>
