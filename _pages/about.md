<p>I am a Professor in <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs">Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk">University of Sheffield</a> and a member
of the <a href="http://catch.org.uk/">Centre for Assistive Technology and Connected
Healthcare (CATCH)</a> at the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk">University of
Sheffield</a>. I am part of the <a href="http://spandh.dcs.shef.ac.uk/">Speech and Hearing Research Group
(SPandH)</a> and a theme lead for the UKRI <a href="https://slt-cdt.ac.uk/">Centre for
Doctoral Training in speech and language technologies and their applications</a>.</p>

<p>I am the technical lead for <a href="www.cognospeak.org">CognoSpeak&trade;</a>, a speech-based tool for detecting and tracking early signs of cognitive impairment.</p>

<p>I have a long-standing interest in improving equality and diversity and I take an active interest in the EDI work within our university. Wider, I am on the diversity committee of <a href="https://www.isca-speech.org/iscaweb/">ISCA (International Speech Communication Association)</a> and the Diversity and Inclusion chair for <a href="https://www.interspeech2023.org/">Interspeech 2023</a>.

<p>My research interests are in the application of audio and speech technology to
the healthcare domain and include three main areas</p>

<ul>
<li>the automatic recognition of disordered, atypical speech,</li>
<li>the detection and tracking of verbal and non-verbal traits in speech and language</li>
<li>Equality, diversity and inclusion issues in speech technology research and applications</li>
</ul>
