<p>I am a Senior Lecturer in <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs">Computer Science</a> at the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk">University of Sheffield</a> and a member
of the <a href="http://catch.org.uk/">Centre for Assistive Technology and Connected
Healthcare (CATCH)</a> at the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk">University of

<p>I am the technical lead for <a href="www.cognospeak.org">CognoSpeak&trade;</a>, a speech-based tool for detecting and tracking early signs of cognitive impairment.</p>

<p>I have a long-standing interest in improving equality and diversity and I am the current <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/about/equality-diversity-inclusion">Faculty Director for Equality, Diversity and Inclusion</a>.

<p>My research interests are in the application of audio and speech technology to
the healthcare domain and include two main areas</p>

<ul>
<li>the automatic recognition of disordered, atypical speech,</li>
<li>the detection and tracking of verbal and non-verbal traits in speech and language</li>
</ul>
