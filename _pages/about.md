<p>I am a <b>Professor and the Head of the School of Computer Science</b> at the University of Sheffield. My research is situated at the intersection of speech technology, AI, and healthcare, where I focus on developing machine learning systems that use spontaneous speech and language biomarkers to detect early signs of clinical conditions.</p>

<p>A major focus of my work is <b>CognoSpeak™</b>, an automated, remote assessment tool for cognitive impairment. My team and I recently published our latest findings on its clinical utility in the <i>IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics</i> (2025). We are also expanding these technologies to support stroke recovery and Motor Neurone Disease (MND).</p>

<p>Beyond my research, I am a dedicated advocate for Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI), having previously served as the Faculty Director of EDI and led the University to a successful <b>Athena SWAN Silver</b> institutional renewal. I currently have over 3,800 citations and an h-index of 36, reflecting my commitment to bridging AI innovation with impactful, real-world healthcare solutions.</p>
