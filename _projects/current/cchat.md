title: "CognoSpeak: a Cognitive Health Assessment Tool (CcHAT)"
excerpt: "This project will develop a quicker and more efficient way to assess people with memory concerns. Our solution is a conversational tool (CognoSpeak:tm:) that asks questions using a ‘talking head’ on a laptop, tablet or smartphone and carefully analyses the spoken answers to detect early signs of dementia. Funded by NIHR i4i; £1.3M; 2022-2025"

<h3 id="summary">Project Description</h3>
Background & Significance 
Every 3 minutes, someone in the UK develops dementia; it is the leading cause of death, and care costs around £26.3 billion a year.  Referrals for assessment have increased six-fold leading to long, frustrating and anxious waiting times for families, delaying access to treatment and support. This is important because lifestyle changes and treatment can delay progression if a diagnosis is made early, reducing health and social care costs.  Over-stretched clinics are unable to monitor people with mild cognitive impairment, despite their 50% risk of developing dementia and some ethnic groups are not accessing diagnosis services.  The CognoSpeak:tm: system has been tested on over 220 people and shown to be reliable and more accurate than pen-and paper tests used currently. It can also detect signs of depression and anxiety. 
 
Aim & Objectives
The project will 
- Work with ethnic groups to understand how CognoSpeak:tm: can be developed to make it easier for them to access memory assessment locally and acceptably 
- Evaluate ease-of-use (by patients in their homes and in GP clinics) to see how it compares to current services 
- Collect a large amount of data from patients and healthy controls to develop a new version and further improve the accuracy
- Provide cost and benefit evidence, so care commissioners can decide whether CognoSpeak:tm: is sufficiently helpful to justify provision via the NHS
- Prepare CognoSpeak:tm: for NHS use.
