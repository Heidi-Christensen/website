**CognoMND** is a clinical research project aimed at adapting the automated speech-analysis framework of CognoSpeak™ to the specific needs of patients living with Motor Neurone Disease (MND).

A major challenge in MND care is the frequent and objective monitoring of bulbar symptoms. This project focuses on:
* **Digital Biomarkers:** Identifying specific speech and language markers that correlate with disease progression and bulbar involvement.
* **Remote Monitoring:** Developing a platform that allows patients to record spontaneous speech samples from home, reducing the burden of frequent clinic visits.
* **Clinical Integration:** Working alongside neurologists to ensure that the automated metrics provided by the system are clinically actionable and support timely interventions.

This work is part of our broader commitment to using AI to provide inclusive, accessible diagnostic and monitoring technologies for patients with complex neurological conditions.
