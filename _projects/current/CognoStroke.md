Supported by funding from the **Rosetrees Trust**, **CognoStroke** investigates the application of speech-based AI biomarkers in the assessment of cognitive health following a stroke.

Cognitive impairment is a common and often under-detected consequence of stroke. This project leverages the **CognoSpeak™** platform to:
* **Detect Post-Stroke Deficits:** Distinguishing between language-specific impairments (aphasia) and broader cognitive decline using multimodal speech data.
* **Predictive Analytics:** Developing machine learning models that can help predict long-term recovery trajectories based on early post-stroke speech samples.
* **Scalable Diagnostics:** Creating a low-cost, remote alternative to traditional pen-and-paper cognitive assessments, which can be difficult to administer frequently in overstretched clinical settings.

By bridging the gap between fundamental speech technology and clinical stroke care, we aim to improve the long-term monitoring and quality of life for stroke survivors.
